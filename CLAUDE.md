## Remaining TODOs

### Pre-Launch Blockers
- [ ] Test full Stripe checkout flow end-to-end (free → upgrade → verify → cancel → verify downgrade)
- [ ] Login page redesign to match dark theme of landing site
- [ ] Rotate credentials that were briefly exposed: DB password, JWT_SECRET, RESEND_API_KEY
- [ ] Reconnect Railway to gstack-ds/spendnod-backend for auto-deploys (currently manual redeploy required)

### Launch Actions
- [ ] Demo video #1 — SDK flow (storyboard ready)
- [ ] Demo video #2 — MCP flow (60 seconds)
- [ ] MCP marketplace listings (mcpmarket.com, PulseMCP, LobeHub)
- [ ] First public post (LinkedIn, Twitter/X)
- [ ] Call Andrew Bosin for ToS/Privacy Policy review (201-446-9643)

### QA / Verification
- [ ] Test MCP with Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, OpenClaw
- [ ] Tier enforcement live test (bash script)

### Later (not launch blockers)
- [ ] Publish SDK to PyPI
- [ ] Webhook callbacks
- [ ] SMS notifications via Twilio
- [ ] Analytics export (CSV download)
- [ ] Slack/Teams integration
- [ ] Push notifications
- [ ] Supabase Realtime (replace polling)
